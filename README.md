# Svelte TypeScript TailwindCSS & Sass Starter

Use TypeScript, TailwindCSS & Sass to quick start your new Svelte and SvelteKit app!!

## 🧐 What's inside?

This Starter includes

- ⚡️ [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
- ⚡️ [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - SvelteKit is built on Svelte, a UI framework that uses a compiler to let you write breathtakingly concise components that do minimal work in the browser, using languages you already know — HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a love letter to web development.
- 👷 [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite
  Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- 🧁 [TailwindCSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes
- ✨ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- 🎉 [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
- 📏 [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) — Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.
- 🦋 [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) — An opinionated code formatter.
- 🐶 [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - Husky improves your commits and more 🐶 woof!
- 🐶 [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) — Run linters against staged git files and don't let 💩 slip into your code base!

The rest of the Starter is based off of the Svelte Skeleton Project.
